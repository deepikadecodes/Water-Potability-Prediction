# Water-Potability-Prediction

ðŸ”¹ Problem:

-- To predict whether a given water sample is safe (potable) or not safe using chemical properties of water.

ðŸ”¹ Objectives:

-- Understand water quality data.

-- Handle missing values and outliers.

-- Balance the dataset using SMOTE.

-- Train multiple machine learning models.

-- Evaluate and compare model performance.

-- Predict potability for real and synthetic samples.
